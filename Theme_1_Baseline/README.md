# IOOS System Test - Theme 1 - Baseline

The baseline assessment theme includes test cases that, as the name of theme states, assess the basic functionality of the Data Management and Communications system. While the test cases for this theme have no slant towards a particular scientific endeavor, the functionality to be tested underlies all subsequent test themes. These test cases will incorporate multiple IOOS Regions and partners, cover a large geographic scope, employ multiple types of data, and cross scientific disciplines. 

To put it simply, the Baseline Assessment theme tests whether registries, catalogs, metadata sets and data sets that are known to meet IOOS certification can be discovered, accessed and used. 

Results from this baseline assessment will include:

*  Basic statistics on the number and type of data sets in each chosen registry or catalog
*  The metadata standards and dialects employed within those registries
*  A determination if the amount of metadata is sufficient to use the data correctly
*  Statistics on the number of types of service protocols/endpoints to access the data
*  For a given area of interest list the total number of variables/data sets available in each catalog; list the variables.
*  Information obtained through the use of IPython scripts will be compared against corresponding information retained by registry, catalog, or data repository owners to evaluate the success of the tests.


For example, in the context of the baseline Modeling Notebook the following assessment should result from running a notebook:
*  A list of model strings used to identify model records and where and how those strings differ or are the same accross catalogs.
*  A list of model records found within each catalog examined.
*  A summary of models by type and geographic region which would help identify those regions with less or more model coverage and of what kind (e.g. inundation models, ecosystem models, etc.).
*  A summary of models, geographic regions covered, and agency that has contributed the model to the catalog where available.
