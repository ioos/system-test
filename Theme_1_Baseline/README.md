IOOS System Test - Theme 1 - Baseline

==============

The baseline assessment theme includes test cases that, as the name of theme states, assess the basic functionality of the Data Management and Communications system. While the test cases for this theme have no slant towards a particular scientific endeavor, the functionality to be tested underlies all subsequent test themes. These test cases will incorporate multiple IOOS Regions and partners, cover a large geographic scope, employ multiple types of data, and cross scientific disciplines. To put it simply, the Baseline Assessment theme tests whether registries, catalogs, metadata sets and data sets that are known to meet IOOS certification can be discovered, accessed and used. Results from this baseline assessment will include:

Basic statistics on the number and type of data sets in each chosen registry or catalog
The metadata standards and dialects employed within those registries
A determination if the amount of metadata is sufficient to use the data correctly
Statistics on the number of types of service protocols/endpoints to access the data
For a given area of interest list the total number of variables/data sets available in each catalog; list the variables.
Information obtained through the use of IPython scripts will be compared against corresponding information retained by registry, catalog, or data repository owners to evaluate the success of the tests.
