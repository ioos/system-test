system-test
===========

A place to discuss, raise issues, and capture progress for the IOOS DMAC System Integration Test project.

* Discuss by commenting on or creating new [System-Test Issues](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/issues?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=open)
* Capture plans, progress by using the [System-Test Wiki](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki)

Intended Use
============

The documentation developed here is intended to guide and inform on the use of Python code to access data described by the meta-data provided by  IOOS. Several test-cases are developed that demonstrate accessing and using data provided by the IOOS and Regional Associations servers. The test-cases are presented as iPython notebooks providing Python code examples and commentary guiding the use of the databases and servers. 

For a full discussion of the purpose of the system-test notebooks, see the web-pages at [System Test Wiki](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki).

How-To
======

The pages used to create the iPython notebooks are available on the [IOOS github site](https://github.com/ioos/system-test). They can be `git clone`d onto your desktop, served using `ipython notebook` and thereby browsed on your chrome or firefox browser locally. They will also be served as iPython notebooks somewhere at the [IOOS Website](https://IOOS.github.io) (*or another site*) from a Wakari, or similar, server (maybe).
