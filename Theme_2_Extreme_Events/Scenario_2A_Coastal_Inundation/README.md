# IOOS System Test - Theme 2 - Extreme Events

## Scenario 2A - Coastal Inundation

As a severe storm is approaching the U.S. East Coast which will result in inundation, flooding, and wind damage over an extensive area. Coastal emergency managers must prepare for and respond to flooding as well as plan and implement evacuations. Emergency managers, forecasters, and researchers currently rely on a number of data sources to do their work, including observations and forecast models:

*  Forecasters are interested to know how federal and non-federal models compare to observed waves, river flows, and water levels, throughout the storm.
*  Coastal emergency managers use inundation and flood data to identify where first responders should dedicate resources.
*  After the storm, researchers want to compare observed data to modeled data to identify model shortcomings and areas of improvement, as well as to quality control observing systems.

The ability to quickly and easily integrate these complementary datasets and predictions into visualizations and analyses will help emergency managers and responders improve their ability to forecast, prepare for and respond to coastal storms.
